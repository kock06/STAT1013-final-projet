## Hypothesis

-   Do men have a higher average percentile in SAT math than women?

-   2 groups of comparison:

    -   **G1**: women math SAT percentile
    -   **G2**: men math SAT percentile

-   response variable will be: math SAT percentile

-response variable is quantitive becausee it's quntile in SAT exam

-   my prediction:
    -   I expect that the percentile of men and the percentile of woman
        will be approximatelly the same, with a little bit higher
        percentile of men
    -   source:

-   If I had unlimited rasources:
    -   I would collect all SAT data of every SAT participant in the
        last 3 years and then verify the hypothesis on those
